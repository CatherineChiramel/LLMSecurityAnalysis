# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code executes the command getent passwd <username> and stores the output in the file pointer output.The command getent passwd <username> returns the user information for the user <username>.The command getent passwd <username> is executed by the system() function.The command getent passwd <username> is executed by the popen() function. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while creating OS commands. Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Use additional security measures where necessary.
