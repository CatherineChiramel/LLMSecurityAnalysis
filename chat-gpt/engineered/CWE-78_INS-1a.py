# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: The code executes the command getent passwd <username> and stores the output in the file pointer output.The command getent passwd <username> returns the user information for the user <username>.The command getent passwd <username> is executed by the system() function.The command getent passwd <username> is executed by the popen() function. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing consistent output encoding and input validation. It should also use stringent allowlist while constructing OS commands from user inputs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import subprocess

# Define the command to be executed
command = ['getent', 'passwd', '<username>']

# Execute the command using subprocess
process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

# Get the output and errors from the command
output, errors = process.communicate()

# Check if there are any errors
if process.returncode != 0:
    print("Error: {}".format(errors.decode('utf-8')))
else:
    # Open the output file in binary mode
    with open('output.txt', 'wb') as f:
        # Write the output to the file
        f.write(output)
