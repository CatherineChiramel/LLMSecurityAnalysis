# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The user enters the stock name and quantity in the form.The form is submitted to the buy_order route.The buy_order route takes the stock name and quantity and inserts it into the database.The user is redirected to the stock_view page.The code is a very simple example of how to insert data into a database. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while creating SQL query strings. Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Use additional security measures where necessary.
