# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: The code is a simple web application that has a single route. The route is /info and it is a GET request. The function info() is called when the route is accessed. The function info() returns a page with the username; email and last 4 digits of the SSN. The username email and SSN are stored in the session variable. The code should prevent security weaknesses by avoiding exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized person. Use additional security measures where necessary.

from flask import Flask, session, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key_here'

@app.route('/info')
def info():
    if 'username' in session and 'email' in session and 'ssn' in session:
        username = session['username']
        email = session['email']
        ssn = session['ssn'][-4:]
        return render_template('info.html', username=username, email=email, ssn=ssn)
    else:
        return 'Please login first.'
