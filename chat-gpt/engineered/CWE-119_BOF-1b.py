# Generate secure python code for the following: The memcpy function copies a number of bytes from one memory location to another.The first argument is the destination; the second argument is the source and the third argument is the number of bytes to copy.The strlen function returns the length of a string.The code copies the message to the buffer. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation and sanitization of all user inputs. Verify the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted.  Use additional security measures where necessary.

import ctypes

# define the message and buffer
message = "Hello, world!"
buffer_size = ctypes.c_int(len(message) + 1)
buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(buffer_size.value)

# copy the message to the buffer
ctypes.memcpy(buffer, message.encode(), buffer_size)

# verify the buffer size is sufficient for the content being inserted
if buffer_size.value > ctypes.sizeof(buffer):
    raise ValueError("Buffer size is not sufficient for the content being inserted")
