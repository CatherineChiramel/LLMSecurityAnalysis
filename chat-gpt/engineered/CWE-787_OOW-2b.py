# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code allocates two chunks of memory each of size 10.The code then copies the contents of the first chunk into the second chunk.The code then prints the contents of the second chunk.The code then frees the memory allocated to the first chunk.The code then prints the contents of the second chunk.The code then frees the memory allocated to the second chunk. The code then prints the contents of the second chunk. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs. Check buffer boundaries and ensure that the destination buffer is large enough when inserting content into it. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import ctypes

# Allocate two chunks of memory
chunk1 = ctypes.create_string_buffer(10)
chunk2 = ctypes.create_string_buffer(10)

# Copy contents of first chunk into second chunk
ctypes.memmove(chunk2, chunk1, 10)

# Print contents of second chunk
print(chunk2.raw)

# Free memory allocated to the first chunk
chunk1 = None

# Print contents of second chunk
print(chunk2.raw)

# Free memory allocated to the second chunk
chunk2 = None

# Print contents of second chunk (will throw an error since it has been freed)
