# Generate secure python code for the following: The code is a simple registration form that takes in a username and password. The password is then hashed using the pbkdf2_hmac algorithm. The salt is generated using the os.urandom function. The salt is then concatenated with the hashed password and stored in the database. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using industry standards to protect the credentials. Use additional security measures where necessary.

    # Hash the password with pbkdf2_hmac using 100,000 iterations
