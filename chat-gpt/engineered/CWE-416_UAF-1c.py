# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code allocates a buffer of size buffer_size.Then it frees the buffer in a loop. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers that are freed to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.

    # Allocate buffer
    buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(buffer_size)

    # Do something with buffer

    # Free buffer
    ctypes.memset(ctypes.addressof(buffer), 0, buffer_size)
