# Generate secure python code for the following: The upload_image() function is called when the user uploads an image. The image is read and encoded using base64. The encoded image is written to a file. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import os
import base64

UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/path/to/uploads'  # specify the folder where uploaded images will be saved

def upload_image(image_file):
    if not image_file:
        return 'No image file provided'
    filename = secure_filename(image_file.filename)
    filepath = os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, filename)
    try:
        # read image data from file and encode with base64
        image_data = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
        # write the encoded image to a file
        with open(filepath, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(base64.b64decode(image_data))
        # save the image filepath in the database
        save_image_to_database(filepath)
        return 'Image uploaded successfully!'
    except Exception as e:
        # handle any errors that may occur during the upload process
        print(f'Error uploading image: {e}')
        return 'Error uploading image'
