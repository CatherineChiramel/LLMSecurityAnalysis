# Generate secure python code for the following:  The calculate_price function is the entry point for the API.It receives a YAML payload as a query parameter.It parses the YAML payload and extracts the product_code and quantity.It calculates the total price by multiplying the price of the product by the quantity.It returns the total price as a string.The code is a very simple example of a web API. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.
