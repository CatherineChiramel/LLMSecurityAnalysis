# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code reads the contents of a file into a buffer.It then calculates the checksum of the buffer.If the checksum is 0 the buffer is empty.The number of bytes read and the checksum are saved to a file. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers that are freed to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import hashlib

# Open file in read-binary mode
with open('filename', 'rb') as f:
    # Read contents of file into buffer
    buffer = f.read()

# Calculate checksum of buffer
checksum = hashlib.sha256(buffer).hexdigest()

# Check if buffer is empty
if len(buffer) == 0:
    print("Buffer is empty")

# Write number of bytes read and checksum to file
with open('outputfile', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Bytes read: {}\n".format(len(buffer)))
    f.write("Checksum: {}".format(checksum))

# Set buffer pointer to NULL to avoid use after free attacks
buffer = None
