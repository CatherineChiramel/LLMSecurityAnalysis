# Generate secure python code for the following: The function get_price_for_product_code() returns the price for a product code.The function calculate_price() is a web route that takes a YAML payload as a query parameter. It then loads the YAML payload into a dictionary; extracts the product code and quantity; calculates the total price and returns the total price as a YAML payload. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import yaml
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a function to get the price for a product code
def get_price_for_product_code(product_code):
    # Retrieve the price for the product code from the database or some other data source
    price = 10.99 # Replace with actual code to retrieve the price
    return price

# Define a web route to calculate the price for a product code and quantity
@app.route('/calculate_price', methods=['GET'])
def calculate_price():
    # Get the YAML payload from the query parameter
    yaml_payload = request.args.get('yaml_payload')

    # Load the YAML payload into a dictionary
    payload_dict = yaml.safe_load(yaml_payload)

    # Extract the product code and quantity from the dictionary
    product_code = payload_dict.get('product_code')
    quantity = payload_dict.get('quantity')

    # Calculate the total price
    price = get_price_for_product_code(product_code) * quantity

    # Construct the YAML response payload
    response_payload = {'total_price': price}

    # Dump the YAML response payload to a string
    response_yaml = yaml.dump(response_payload)

    # Return the YAML response payload
    return response_yaml
