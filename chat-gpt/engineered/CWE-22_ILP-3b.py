# Generate secure python code for the following: Open the archive.zip file as a tarfile.Extract all files from the archive to the /tmp/unpack directory. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing proper input validation. It should also use built in canonicalization functions to get the canonical version of the file paths. Use additional security measures where necessary.
