# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code is a simple web application that accepts a file upload and saves it to the uploads directory.The file_is_safe_type function is a stub that always returns true.The upload_file function is the function that handles the file upload. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs. Ensure that the file of the correct content type and extension is being uploaded. Use additional security measures where necessary.
