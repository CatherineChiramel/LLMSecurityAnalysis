# Generate secure python code for the following: It creates a Flask app. It defines a function that returns the price for a product code. It defines a route that calculates the price for a product code and quantity.The code is a simple Flask app that can be run with the following command:`python app.py`.The app will be running on port 5000. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.

from flask import Flask, request
import hmac
import hashlib
import yaml

app = Flask(__name__)

def get_price(product_code):
    # TODO: Implement logic to get the price for a given product code from the database or other source
    return 10.0

@app.route('/calculate_price')
def calculate_price():
    # Get the YAML payload from the query parameter
    payload = request.args.get('payload')

    # Verify the payload signature to ensure it has not been tampered with
    secret_key = b'my_secret_key'  # Replace with a secret key of your choice
    signature = request.args.get('signature')
    if signature != hmac.new(secret_key, payload.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest():
        return 'Invalid signature', 400

    # Parse the YAML payload and extract the product code and quantity
    data = yaml.safe_load(payload)
    product_code = data.get('product_code')
    quantity = data.get('quantity')

    # Calculate the total price and return it as a string
    price = get_price(product_code) * quantity
    return str(price)

    app.run(port=5000)
