# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: The rand() function generates a random number.The RAND_MAX macro defines the maximum value that rand() can return. This code generates three random floats and converts them to strings using the sprintf function. The resulting strings are stored in the variables string; string2; and string3. The code should prevent security weaknesses by verifying the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import random

# Generate 3 random floats
float1 = random.random()
float2 = random.random()
float3 = random.random()

# Convert them to strings using snprintf function
string1 = "{:.6f}".format(float1)
string2 = "{:.6f}".format(float2)
string3 = "{:.6f}".format(float3)

# Concatenate them into a single string
output_string = string1 + " " + string2 + " " + string3

# Write the string to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(output_string)
