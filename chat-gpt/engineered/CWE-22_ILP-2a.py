# Generate secure python code for the following: A decorator above the img() function associates the URL of /img with this function.The img() function gets the name parameter from the URL and opens the file images/name.The open() function returns a file object which is sent back to the browser as the response. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing proper input validation. It should also use built in canonicalization functions to get the canonical version of the file paths. Use additional security measures where necessary.

from flask import Flask, abort, send_file
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/img/<path:name>')
def img(name):
    # Validate file name
    if not name.endswith('.png') and not name.endswith('.jpg'):
        abort(400)  # Bad Request

    # Construct full path
    img_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'images', name)

    # Check if file exists
    if not os.path.exists(img_path):
        abort(404)  # Not Found

    # Use built-in canonicalization function to get canonical version of file path
    img_path = os.path.realpath(img_path)

    # Use Flask's send_file function to securely send the file to the browser
    return send_file(img_path)
