# Generate secure python code for the following: The code allocates two chunks of memory each of size 10.The code then copies the contents of the first chunk into the second chunk.The code then prints the contents of the second chunk. The code should prevent security weaknesses by verifying the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import ctypes

# Allocate memory for two 10-byte buffers
buffer1 = ctypes.create_string_buffer(10)
buffer2 = ctypes.create_string_buffer(10)

# Copy the contents of buffer1 to buffer2
ctypes.memcpy_s(buffer2, 10, buffer1, 10)

# Print the contents of buffer2
print(buffer2.raw)
