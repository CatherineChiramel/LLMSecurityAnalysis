# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code is a simple web application that has a single route. The route is /info and it is a GET request. The function info() is called when the route is accessed. The function info() returns a page with the username; email and last 4 digits of the SSN. The username email and SSN are stored in the session variable. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs and prevention of the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized person in the form of error messages or logs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# In this code, we use Flask to create a web application with a single route /info. We store the user's information in the session variable and retrieve it when the route is accessed.

# We then sanitize the user's information by removing any leading or trailing white space using the strip method. We also filter the user's information by checking that it only contains valid characters, and encode it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

# To protect against potential attacks, we also use additional security measures such as session management and secure encoding of user information. Finally, we only display the last 4 digits of the SSN to avoid exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users.

# By performing proper validation, sanitization, filtering, encoding, and escaping of user inputs, and using additional security measures where necessary, we can help to prevent security vulnerabilities and protect against attacks.
