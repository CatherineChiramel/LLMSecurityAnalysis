# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The code is a program that takes in a command line argument and prints it out to the console. It also trims any trailing whitespace characters from the argument before printing it out. The code should prevent security weaknesses by verifying the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import sys

# Define buffer size
buffer_size = 128

# Check for exactly one argument
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Error: Invalid number of arguments")
    sys.exit()

# Get input from command line and trim trailing whitespace
input = sys.argv[1].rstrip()

# Verify destination buffer is large enough
if len(input) > buffer_size:
    print("Error: Destination buffer is too small")
    sys.exit()

# Securely copy input to buffer and null terminate
buffer = bytearray(buffer_size)
buffer[:len(input)] = input.encode('utf-8')
buffer[len(input)] = 0

# Print contents of buffer
print(buffer.decode('utf-8'))

# In this code, we're defining a buffer size of 128 and checking that the user provided exactly one argument using len(sys.argv). If the number of arguments is not exactly one, we print an error message and exit the program using sys.exit().

# We're then getting the input from the command line and trimming any trailing whitespace using the rstrip() method.

# To prevent security weaknesses, we're verifying that the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted by checking if the length of the input is greater than the buffer size. If the buffer is too small, we print an error message and exit the program.

# If the destination buffer is large enough, we're securely copying the input to the buffer using the bytearray() function and encode() method. We're also adding a null terminator to the end of the buffer using buffer[len(input)] = 0.

# Finally, we're printing the contents of the buffer using the decode() method.

# Overall, this code uses secure memory management practices to prevent common security weaknesses like buffer overflow attacks. The code verifies that the destination buffer is large enough before copying data to it, and null terminates the data to ensure that it is properly formatted.
