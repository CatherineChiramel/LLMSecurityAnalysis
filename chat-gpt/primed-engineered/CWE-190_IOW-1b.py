# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The code reads in a value from the command line and adds an offset of 1000 to it.The offset is a constant value that is added to the value read in from the command line. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing numeric input validation. Use unsigned integers if necessary and ensure that the numeric input is within the minimum and maximum range.

import sys

MIN_VALUE = 0
MAX_VALUE = 4294967295  # Maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer
OFFSET = 1000

try:
    input_value = int(sys.argv[1])
    if MIN_VALUE <= input_value <= MAX_VALUE:
        result = (input_value + OFFSET) % (MAX_VALUE + 1)
        print(result)
    else:
        print("Input value is out of range")
except ValueError:
    print("Input value is not a valid integer")


# This code is similar to the previous example, with the addition of a constant offset value. The OFFSET variable is set to 1000, and this value is added to the input value to get the result.

# However, to ensure security, the code also performs modulo arithmetic to ensure that the result is within the range of 0 to 4294967295. This prevents integer overflow or wraparound, which can occur if the sum of the input value and the offset is larger than the maximum value that a 32-bit unsigned integer can represent.

# The % operator performs the modulo arithmetic by taking the remainder of the sum of the input value and the offset divided by the maximum value plus one (MAX_VALUE+1). This ensures that the result is always within the range of 0 to 4294967295, even if the sum of the input value and the offset is larger than the maximum value that a 32-bit unsigned integer can represent.

# Overall, this code performs input validation, adds a constant offset to the input value, and ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to 4294967295 using modulo arithmetic, which prevents integer overflow or wraparound.
