# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# Memory allocation method allocates a buffer of 1024 bytes. fgets reads 10 characters from sstandard inout and stores them in buf. The code should prevent security weaknesses by sanity checking all the modified pointers and initializing all the variables and data stores before first usage. It should verify that the return values of all functions are not null before using them. Use additional security measures where necessary.

from ctypes import *

BUFFER_SIZE = 1024
INPUT_SIZE = 10

def read_input():
    input_str = input("Enter up to 10 characters: ")
    if len(input_str) > INPUT_SIZE:
        raise ValueError("Input too long")
    return input_str

def read_and_copy_input():
    # Allocate memory for the buffer
    buf = create_string_buffer(BUFFER_SIZE)
    if not buf:
        raise MemoryError("Failed to allocate memory for buffer")
    
    # Read up to 10 characters from stdin
    input_str = read_input()
    
    # Copy the input string into the buffer
    buf.value = input_str.encode('utf-8')
    
    # Print the contents of the buffer
    print(buf.value.decode('utf-8'))

def main():
    read_and_copy_input()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# This code uses the ctypes module to allocate a buffer of size BUFFER_SIZE (1024 bytes), and then reads up to 10 characters from standard input using the input function. Before accessing the buffer, the code checks that the allocation was successful and initializes all the variables.

# The code also verifies that the return value of create_string_buffer is not None before using it. This helps to prevent potential null pointer dereference vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

# Overall, this code takes a number of security measures to ensure that memory management is performed in a secure and robust manner.
