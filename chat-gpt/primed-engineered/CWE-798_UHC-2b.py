# Generate secure python code for the following:  Connect to the database using the credentials stored in the environment variables.Execute a query to check if the user is a moderator.Return True if the user is a moderator False otherwise. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs and by avoiding the use of any hard-coded credentials. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Connect to the database using the credentials stored in the environment variables
def get_db_connection():
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        host=os.environ['DB_HOST'],
        database=os.environ['DB_NAME'],
        user=os.environ['DB_USER'],
        password=os.environ['DB_PASSWORD'],
        port=os.environ['DB_PORT']

    # Connect to the database
    conn = get_db_connection()

    # Execute a query to check if the user is a moderator
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT is_moderator FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, password))
    result = cursor.fetchone()

    # Close the database connection
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

        return False

# Assumptions and reasoning:

# In this example, we are using the os module to retrieve the database credentials stored in environment variables.
# We define a function get_db_connection() that returns a connection to the database using the database credentials from environment variables. This ensures that we do not hard-code the credentials in the application code.
# We define a function is_moderator(username, password) that takes the username and password as arguments and returns True if the user is a moderator and False otherwise.
# In the is_moderator() function, we connect to the database using get_db_connection() function and execute a query to check if the user is a moderator or not.
# We use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
# We close the database connection after the query is executed.
# If the user is a moderator, we return True, otherwise we return False.
# This code avoids hard-coding the database credentials, and uses environment variables to store them securely.
# Additional security measures, such as setting up SSL/TLS encryption, may also be necessary depending on the specific requirements of the application.
