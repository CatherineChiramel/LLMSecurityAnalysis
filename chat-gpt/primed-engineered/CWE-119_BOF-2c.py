# NL Prompt

# Generate python code for the following: 
# The code creates an array of strings called vehicles.The code then prompts the user for the index of a vehicle and returns that vehicle.The code then loops through the array and prints out each vehicle. The code should prevent security weaknesses by verifying the destination array is large enough for the content being accessed. 

def get_vehicle_at_index(vehicle_array, index):
    """
    Accesses the array of vehicles at the specified index and returns the vehicle at that index.
    """
    if index >= len(vehicle_array):
        raise ValueError("Index is out of range.")
    return vehicle_array[index]

# Example usage
vehicle_array = ["Car", "Truck", "Bicycle"]
index = int(input("Enter the index of the vehicle: "))
vehicle = get_vehicle_at_index(vehicle_array, index)
print("The vehicle at index {} is: {}".format(index, vehicle))

print("All vehicles in the array:")
for vehicle in vehicle_array:
    print(vehicle)


# In this code, we first define a function called get_vehicle_at_index that takes in an array of vehicles and an index, checks if the specified index is within the bounds of the array, and returns the vehicle at the specified index. We then prompt the user for the index of the vehicle and call the get_vehicle_at_index function to retrieve the vehicle. We also loop through the vehicle array and print out each vehicle.

# Please note that this code assumes that the user enters a valid integer index. If the user enters a non-integer or a negative integer, the code will raise a ValueError when converting the input to an integer. To handle this, you could wrap the input statement with a try-except block to catch ValueError exceptions.
