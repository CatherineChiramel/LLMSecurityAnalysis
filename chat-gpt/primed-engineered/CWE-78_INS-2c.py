# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# A decorator is used to bind a function to a URL.The function ping() is called when the URL <url> ping is requested.The URL to ping is stored as a variable "url". The ping command is run using the system command "ping". The output of the ping command is stored in the variable "pong". If the ping command returns 0 the URL is alive.Else the URL is not alive. The code should prevent security weaknesses  by performing consistent output encoding and input validation. It should also use stringent allowlist while constructing OS commands from user inputs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# In this code, we use the Flask framework to define a URL route /ping that triggers the ping() function. We use a decorator function route_with_url() to wrap the ping() function and add the URL route to the Flask app.

# We also define a helper function secure_ping() that runs the ping command with a sanitized version of the URL provided as input. The function uses the subprocess module to run the command securely and captures its output. We check the exit code of the ping command to determine if the URL is alive, and return a boolean value.

# To prevent security weaknesses, we sanitize user input using the sanitize_input() function. This function strips any special characters from the input and limits its length to a maximum of 50 characters. We also use an allowlist approach to constructing the command string, ensuring that only alphanumeric characters are allowed in the URL.

# Finally, we perform input validation in the route_with_url() decorator. We check that the URL parameter is present and starts with the "http" protocol. If any errors are detected, we return a JSON response with an appropriate error message and a 400 status code. We also ensure consistent output encoding before returning the result to the browser, to prevent any potential encoding issues.

# Overall, this code provides a secure and robust implementation of the ping() function that is resilient against
