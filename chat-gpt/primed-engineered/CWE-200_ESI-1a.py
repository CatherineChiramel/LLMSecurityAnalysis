# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  There is a login page that takes in username and password. There is a database that stores the username and password. The application should check if the username and password entered by the user matches the username and password in the database. If it matches the application should log the user in and redirect him to the dashboard page. If it doesn't match the application should redirect him back to the login page. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs and prevention of the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized person in the form of error messages or logs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# In this code, we use Flask to create a simple login page that accepts a username and password from the user. We then sanitize the username and password inputs by removing any leading or trailing whitespace using the strip method.

# We also use a secure method to store the user's session data by setting the secret_key attribute of the Flask application. This helps to prevent attackers from tampering with session data or accessing sensitive information.

# We use SQLite to store the usernames and passwords in a database table, and query the database to check if the user's credentials are valid. If the user's credentials are valid, we store the username in a session variable and redirect them to the dashboard page. If the user's credentials are not valid, we clear any existing session data and redirect them back to the login page with an error message
