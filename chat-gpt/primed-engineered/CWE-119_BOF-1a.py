# Generate secure python code for the following:  The memcpy function copies a number of bytes from one memory location to another.The first argument is the destination; the second argument is the source and the third argument is the number of bytes to copy.The strlen function returns the length of a string not including the null terminator.The + 1 is to include the null terminator in the copy. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs. Check buffer boundaries and ensure that the destination buffer is large enough when inserting content into it. Use additional security measures where necessary. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import ctypes

def secure_memcpy(dest, dest_size, src):
    """
    Copies a number of bytes from the source memory location to the destination memory location
    while ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted.
    """
    src_len = ctypes.cdll.msvcrt.strlen(src) + 1
    if src_len > dest_size:
        raise ValueError("Destination buffer is not large enough for the content being inserted.")
    ctypes.cdll.msvcrt.memcpy(dest, src, src_len)

# Example usage
dest_buffer = bytearray(10)
src_buffer = b"Hello, World!"
secure_memcpy(dest_buffer, len(dest_buffer), src_buffer)

# In this code, we use the ctypes library to call the C standard library functions, memcpy and strlen, from Python. We ensure that the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted by comparing its size with the length of the source string (including the null terminator). If the source string is larger than the destination buffer, we raise a ValueError. Otherwise, we call the memcpy function to copy the source string to the destination buffer.

# Please note that this code assumes that the destination buffer is a byte array. If it's a different data type, such as an integer array, the size calculation will be different, and the code will need to be adapted accordingly. Also, this code is specific to the Windows platform and may need to be adapted for other platforms.
