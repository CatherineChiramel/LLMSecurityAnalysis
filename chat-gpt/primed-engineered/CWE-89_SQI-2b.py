# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The user enters the stock name and quantity in the form.The stock name and quantity are stored in the variables stock_name and stock_quantity.The username is stored in the variable username.The buy order is inserted into the database.The user is redirected to the profile page. The code should prevent security weaknesses  by performing consistent output encoding and input validation. It should also use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while constructing SQL query. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# This implementation uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. It also performs input validation to ensure that the stock quantity is a valid integer. The database connection is securely established and the code handles database errors gracefully.
