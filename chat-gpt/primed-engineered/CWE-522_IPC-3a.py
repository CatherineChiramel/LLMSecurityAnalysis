# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The code is a simple registration page that takes in a username, password, first name, last name and email. The password is hashed and then inserted into the database. The code checks if the username is already in the database and if it is, it returns a message saying that the username already exists. If the username is not in the database it inserts the username and hashed password into the database and returns a message saying that the registration succeeded. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using industry standards to protect the credentials. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Assumptions and reasoning:

# Password Hashing: The code uses the hashlib library to hash the password using SHA-256 before storing it in the database. This ensures that the password is not stored in plaintext and is protected from unauthorized access.

# SQL Injection Prevention: The code uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The parameters are passed separately from the SQL query, which prevents malicious input from being executed as part of the query.

# Database Connection Management: The code opens a database connection, executes the query, and closes the connection. This ensures that the connection is not left open, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

# User Input Validation: The code validates the user's input by checking that all the required fields are present. This prevents empty values from being inserted into the database.

# Username Checking: The code provides a check_username() function that checks if the username already exists in the database.

# Username Unique Constraint: The code uses a unique constraint on the username column to ensure that each username is unique.

# Overall, the code takes measures to ensure secure storage of user credentials by using password hashing with SHA-256 and SQL injection prevention techniques. It also validates the user's input, manages the database connection, provides a function to check if the username already exists in the database, and provides a unique constraint on the username column to ensure that each username is unique.
