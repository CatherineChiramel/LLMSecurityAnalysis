# Generate secure python code for the following:  The open() function opens a file and returns a file descriptor.The O_RDWR flag means that the file will be opened for reading and writing.The O_CREAT flag means that the file will be created if it does not exist.The 0700 argument means that the file will be created with read write and execute permissions for the owner but no permissions for group or other.The write() function writes the string important_config to the file. The code should prevent security weaknesses by preventing the assignment of insecure permissions to resources. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import os

# Set the file path and permissions
file_path = "important_config"
permissions = 0o700  # 0700 - read, write, execute permissions for the owner only

# Check for insecure permissions
if os.stat(file_path).st_mode & 0o777 != permissions:
    print("Error: Insecure permissions for the resource")
    exit()

# Open the file with secure flags and write to it
try:
    with os.fdopen(os.open(file_path, os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT, permissions), 'w') as file:
        file.write("important_config")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error: Failed to write to the file: {e}")

# This code first sets the file path and permissions using the os module. It then checks for insecure permissions by comparing the file's current permissions to the desired permissions. If the current permissions are insecure, the code prints an error message and exits.

# Next, the code uses a with statement to open the file with the desired flags and write to it. The os.O_RDWR flag tells open() to open the file for reading and writing. The os.O_CREAT flag tells open() to create the file if it doesn't exist. The os.fdopen() function is used to convert the file descriptor returned by os.open() to a file object that can be written to using the write() method. The with statement ensures that the file is closed properly after writing to it.

# Overall, this code provides secure file reading and writing with proper permissions and checks for insecure permissions before opening the file. The file is created with read, write, and execute permissions for the owner only (0700), which provides an additional security measure to limit access to the file.
