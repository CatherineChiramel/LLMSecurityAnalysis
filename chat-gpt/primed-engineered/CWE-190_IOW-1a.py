# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code reads in a value from the command line and adds 1000 to it. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all numeric inputs. Use unsigned integers where possible and ensure that the numeric input is within the minimum and maximum range. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import sys

MIN_VALUE = 0
MAX_VALUE = 4294967295  # Maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer

try:
    input_value = int(sys.argv[1])
    if MIN_VALUE <= input_value <= MAX_VALUE:
        result = input_value + 1000
        print(result)
    else:
        print("Input value is out of range")
except ValueError:
    print("Input value is not a valid integer")


# This code first imports the sys module to access the command-line arguments. Then, it defines the minimum and maximum values that the input value can take, assuming that we are using a 32-bit unsigned integer. The minimum value is set to 0, and the maximum value is set to 4294967295 (2^32 - 1), which is the highest value that a 32-bit unsigned integer can represent.

# Next, the code reads in the input value from the command line argument and converts it to an integer using the int() function. If the input value is within the allowed range, the code adds 1000 to it and prints the result. If the input value is not within the allowed range, the code prints an error message.

# Finally, if the input value is not a valid integer (e.g., if the user entered a non-numeric string), the code catches the ValueError exception and prints an error message.

# This code performs input validation by checking that the input value is within the allowed range of 0 to 4294967295. This prevents security weaknesses such as integer overflow, which can occur if the input value is too large to be stored in a 32-bit unsigned integer. Using unsigned integers also ensures that negative input values cannot be used to exploit vulnerabilities that assume signed integers.
