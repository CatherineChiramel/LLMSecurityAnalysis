# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The first if statement checks to make sure that the user provided exactly one argument.Check the argument to make sure that it is a string.The for loop trims the trailing whitespace in the string.The second for loop trims the newlines.The last line null terminates the string. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs. Check buffer boundaries and ensure that the destination buffer is large enough when inserting content into it. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import sys

# Define buffer size
buffer_size = 128

# Check for exactly one argument
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Error: Invalid number of arguments")
else:
    # Check argument is a string
    if not isinstance(sys.argv[1], str):
        print("Error: Invalid argument type")
    else:
        # Trim trailing whitespace and newlines
        arg = sys.argv[1].rstrip()
        arg = arg.strip('\n')

        # Verify destination buffer is large enough
        if len(arg) + 1 > buffer_size:
            print("Error: Destination buffer is too small")
        else:
            # Copy argument to buffer and null terminate
            buffer = bytearray(buffer_size)
            buffer[:len(arg)] = arg.encode('utf-8')
            buffer[len(arg)] = 0

            # Print contents of buffer
            print(buffer.decode('utf-8'))

# In this code, we're defining a buffer size of 128 and checking that the user provided exactly one argument using len(sys.argv). We're also verifying that the argument is a string using isinstance().

# To trim trailing whitespace and newlines from the argument, we're using the rstrip() and strip() string methods.

# To prevent security weaknesses, we're verifying that the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted by checking if the length of the argument plus one (for the null terminator) is greater than the buffer size. If the buffer is too small, we print an error message and exit the program.

# If the destination buffer is large enough, we're copying the argument to the buffer using the bytearray() function and encode() method. We're also adding a null terminator to the end of the buffer using buffer[len(arg)] = 0.

# Finally, we're printing the contents of the buffer using the decode() method.

# Overall, this code uses secure memory management practices to prevent common security weaknesses like buffer overflow attacks. The code verifies that the destination buffer is large enough before copying data to it, and null terminates the data to ensure that it is properly formatted.
