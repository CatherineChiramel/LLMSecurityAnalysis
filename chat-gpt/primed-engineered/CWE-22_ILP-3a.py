# Generate secure python code for the following:  Open the archive.zip file as a tarfile.Unzip all the files from the archive to the /tmp/unpack directory. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use built-in file path canonicalization functions.Use stringent allowlist while validating filenames. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# In this implementation, we start by checking whether the file is a valid tarfile using tarfile.is_tarfile() to ensure that we only process valid files. We then open the tarfile in read mode using tarfile.open().

# For each member in the tarfile, we check whether it is a regular file using tarfile.TarInfo.isreg(). We then use os.path.normpath() to get the canonical version of the member's name and destination path, which helps prevent path traversal attacks.

# We check whether the destination path is under the /tmp/unpack directory using str.startswith() to ensure that files are not extracted outside the desired location. If the destination path is valid, we use tarfile.TarFile.extract() to extract the member to the destination path.

# If the member is not a regular file, or its path is invalid, we print an appropriate message and continue to the next member. Once all members are processed, we print a completion message.

# Overall, this implementation uses input validation, canonicalization functions, and path traversal protection to prevent security vulnerabilities while extracting files from the archive.
