# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The program takes a single argument from the command line which is the size of the buffer to allocate.The program allocates a buffer of the specified size.The program prints the contents of the buffer.The program exits. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import sys
import ctypes

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Please specify buffer size as command-line argument")
    sys.exit(1)

buffer_size = int(sys.argv[1])
buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(buffer_size)
ctypes.memset(buffer, ord('A'), buffer_size)

# Print the contents of the buffer
print(buffer.raw.decode())

# Securely free the buffer
ctypes.memset(ctypes.addressof(buffer), 0, ctypes.sizeof(buffer))
buffer = None


# In this code, we're using sys.argv to read the command-line argument specifying the buffer size. We're then using the ctypes library to allocate a buffer of the specified size on the stack. We're using memset() to overwrite all values in the buffer with 'A', and then printing the contents of the buffer using buffer.raw.decode().

# To avoid use after free attacks, we're securely freeing the buffer by setting the pointers to NULL using ctypes.memset(). We're also setting the buffer variable to None to indicate that the memory is no longer being used and can be safely freed by the Python garbage collector.

# Overall, this code uses secure memory management practices to prevent common security weaknesses like use after free attacks. The use of ctypes ensures that the memory is securely allocated and can't be easily accessed or manipulated by malicious actors.
