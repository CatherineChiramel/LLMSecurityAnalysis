# This code uses the Flask web framework to handle incoming requests. The / route is used to handle POST requests. The function get_name first verifies the integrity of the payload using a shared secret key and HMAC-SHA256 signature. If the signature is valid, the payload is deserialized using the json.loads function. A new object user_data is created to hold the deserialized data. The function then checks for the existence of the name field in the payload. If the field exists, the value is stored in user_data['name'] and returned to the user. If the field does not exist, an error message is returned.

# This code uses several security measures to prevent common vulnerabilities. The use of a shared secret key and HMAC-SHA256 signature ensures that the payload has not been tampered with in transit. The use of json.loads to deserialize the payload reduces the risk of injection attacks. Creating a new object user_data to hold the deserialized data reduces the risk of data tampering or injection.
