# Generate secure python code for the following:  Create a web app. Define a route for the app. Define a function that will be called when the route is called.Connect to the database.Execute a query to check if the user is a moderator.Return the result of the query. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs and by avoiding the use of any hard-coded credentials. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Assumptions and reasoning:

# In this example, we are using Flask as the web framework and psycopg2 to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
# We define a function get_db_connection() that returns a connection to the database using the database credentials. This ensures that we do not hard-code the credentials in the application code.
# We define a route /check_mod that accepts GET requests.
# In the function check_mod(), we retrieve the username and password from the request using request.args.get() method.
# We connect to the database using get_db_connection() function and execute a query to check if the user is a moderator or not.
# We use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
# We close the database connection after the query is executed.
# If the user is a moderator, we return the string "User is a moderator", otherwise we return "User is not a moderator".
# We set the __name__ variable to '__main__' to indicate that this is the main module that should be executed.
# We use the app.run() method to run the Flask application.
