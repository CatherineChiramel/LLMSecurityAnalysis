# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# There is a form in an html page that allows the user to upload a pdf file. There is a web server that is running on the user's localhost. The application should upload the pdf file to the user's web server and save it in a folder called uploads. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Here's an explanation of the security considerations in the code:

# Handling multipart/form-data: We check that the Content-Type header is set to multipart/form-data to ensure that the request is properly formatted. Multipart/form-data is a common way of encoding binary data (like a file) in an HTTP request.

# Parsing the body: We parse the multipart/form-data body to extract the filename and contents of the file. This ensures that the uploaded file is properly saved to the server.

# Setting the filepath to NULL: We set the filepath to None after saving the file to prevent use after free attacks. Use after free attacks can occur when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. By setting the filepath to None, we ensure that the pointer can no longer be used.

# Using http.server: We use the http.server module to handle the HTTP requests. This module is part of the Python standard library and provides a simple way to handle HTTP requests. By using a well-vetted library, we reduce the likelihood of introducing security vulnerabilities into the code.

# Running the server on localhost: We only run the server on localhost to ensure that the file uploads are only accessible on the user's own machine. This prevents attackers from accessing the files by sending requests to the user's IP address.
