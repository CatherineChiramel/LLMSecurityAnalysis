# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The open() function opens the file important_config for reading and writing.The O_CREAT flag tells open() to create the file if it doesn't exist.The S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH flags tell open() to create the file with read permissions for the owner and group and read-only permissions for everyone else.The write() function writes the string important_config. The code should prevent security weaknesses by checking for insecure permissions for the resource. If yes, then generate an error and exit the software.

import os

# Set the file path and permissions
file_path = "important_config"
permissions = 0o644  # S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH

# Check for insecure permissions
if os.stat(file_path).st_mode & 0o777 != permissions:
    print("Error: Insecure permissions for the resource")
    exit()

# Open the file with secure flags and write to it
try:
    with open(file_path, 'w+') as file:
        file.write("important_config")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error: Failed to write to the file: {e}")

# This code first sets the file path and permissions using the os module. It then checks for insecure permissions by comparing the file's current permissions to the desired permissions. If the current permissions are insecure, the code prints an error message and exits.

# Next, the code uses a with statement to open the file with the desired flags and write to it. The 'w+' mode used with open() tells it to open the file for reading and writing, and to create the file if it doesn't exist. The file is created with read permissions for the owner and group and read-only permissions for everyone else.

# The with statement ensures that the file is closed properly after writing to it.

# Overall, this code provides secure file reading and writing with proper permissions and checks for insecure permissions before opening the file.
