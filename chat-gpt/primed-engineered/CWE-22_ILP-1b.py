# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code reads a requested file from the /safe/ directory. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use built-in file path canonicalization functions.Use stringent allowlist while validating filenames. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import os

# Assume file_path is provided by user input
file_path = input("Enter file path:")

# Use built-in function to get canonical version of file path
file_path = os.path.realpath(file_path)

# Check if file_path is within the safe directory
if not file_path.startswith('/safe/'):
    raise ValueError('File path is not within the safe directory')

# Open the file securely
with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
    file_content = f.read()

# Process file content as needed


# In this code, we use the built-in os.path.realpath() function to get the canonical version of the file path. This helps prevent security weaknesses such as directory traversal attacks. We then validate that the file path is within the /safe/ directory by checking if it starts with /safe/. If the file path is not within the safe directory, we raise a ValueError.

# Finally, we securely open the file using a with statement, which automatically closes the file when we're done with it. This helps prevent resource leaks and makes sure that the file is properly closed even if an exception occurs.

# Note: This code assumes that the /safe/ directory exists and is accessible to the user running the script. If it doesn't exist or is not accessible, additional checks and error handling would need to be added.
