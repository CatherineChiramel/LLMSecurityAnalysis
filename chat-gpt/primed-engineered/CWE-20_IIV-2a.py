# Generate secure python code for the following:  The redirect_url function takes a url as an argument.The urlparse function from an imported module is used to parse the url.The network location attribute of the parsed_url object is used to get the domain name of the url.If the domain name is example.com the url is redirected.If the domain name is not example.com a 404 error is returned. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Perform validation after combining data from multiple sources. Convert all the inputs into the expected datatypes and ensure proper encoding of data is applied at each interface. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import urllib.parse
from flask import abort, redirect

def redirect_url(url):
    # Validate the URL by checking that it starts with http:// or https://
    if not url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
        abort(400)

    # Sanitize the URL by removing any query parameters and fragments
    url = urllib.parse.urldefrag(url)[0]
    url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)._replace(query=None).geturl()

    # Filter the URL by checking that it only contains valid characters
    if not all(c.isprintable() and c not in '"\'<>\{\}|\\\^`' for c in url):
        abort(400)

    # Encode the URL by converting any non-ASCII characters to percent-encoded UTF-8
    url = urllib.parse.quote(url, safe=':/?=&#')

    # Escape the URL by replacing any percent-encoded characters with their ASCII equivalents
    url = urllib.parse.unquote(url)

    # Parse the URL to extract the domain name
    parsed_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    domain_name = parsed_url.netloc

    # Check if the domain name is example.com and redirect or return a 404 error accordingly
    if domain_name == 'example.com':
        return redirect(url)
    else:
        abort(404)

# In this code, we first validate the user-supplied URL by checking that it starts with either http:// or https://. We then sanitize the URL by removing any query parameters and fragments using the urldefrag function, and remove any query string using the _replace method and geturl() method of the urlparse object.

# Next, we filter the URL by checking that it only contains printable ASCII characters and does not contain any characters that may be used in attacks such as " or <.

# Then, we encode the URL using the quote function from the urllib.parse module, which percent-encodes any non-ASCII characters. We also pass a safe parameter to the quote function to indicate that the colon, slash, question mark, equal sign, ampersand, and hash characters should not be encoded.

# Finally, we escape the URL by replacing any percent-encoded characters with their ASCII equivalents using the unquote function from the urllib.parse module.

# After these steps, we parse the URL using the urlparse function to extract the domain name, and then check if the domain name is example.com. If it is, we use Flask's redirect function to safely redirect the user to the supplied URL. If the domain name is not example.com, we return a 404 error using Flask's abort function.

# By performing proper validation, sanitization, filtering, encoding, and escaping of user inputs, we can help to prevent security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and other types of attacks that may exploit input validation weaknesses.
