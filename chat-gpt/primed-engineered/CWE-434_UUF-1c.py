# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# There is a web app that accepts a pdf file and saves it in a folder called uploads. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import os
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

UPLOADS_DIR = '/path/to/uploads/folder'
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'pdf'}

app = Flask(__name__)

def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and \
           filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_pdf():
    # Check that the request contains a file
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No file in request'})

    file = request.files['file']

    # Check that the file has a valid extension
    if not allowed_file(file.filename):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid file extension'})

    # Generate a random filename to prevent filename collisions
    filename = os.urandom(16).hex() + '.pdf'
    filepath = os.path.join(UPLOADS_DIR, filename)

    # Save the file to the uploads directory
    file.save(filepath)

    # Set the filepath to NULL to prevent use after free attacks
    filepath = None

    return jsonify({'filename': filename})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

# Here's an explanation of the security considerations in the code:

# Validating file extensions: We check that the uploaded file has a valid extension (in this case, pdf). This prevents attackers from uploading files with unexpected extensions (like a file with a .exe extension that could be used to execute malicious code).

# Random filenames: We generate random filenames to prevent filename collisions. This ensures that an attacker cannot upload a file with a filename that overwrites an existing file, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information.

# Setting the filepath to NULL: We set the filepath to None after saving the file to prevent use after free attacks. Use after free attacks can occur when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. By setting the filepath to None, we ensure that the pointer can no longer be used.

# Using Flask: We use the Flask framework to handle HTTP requests. Flask is a well-vetted framework that provides a simple way to handle web requests. By using a well-vetted framework, we reduce the likelihood of introducing security vulnerabilities into the code.

# Using jsonify to return responses: We use the jsonify function to return JSON responses to the client. This ensures that the response is properly formatted and prevents attackers from injecting unexpected data into the response.
