# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The login page is a simple form with a username and password field. The do_login function checks the username and password and if they are correct it sets the username in the session and redirects to the secret page.The index page is a simple page that has a link to the login page.The secret page is a simple page that says, "Secret settings". The code should prevent security weaknesses through strong authentication of users who are allowed access to critical functions.

# In this implementation, we use the Flask web framework to define three routes: /login, /secret, and /. The /login route provides a simple login form with username and password fields. The /secret route displays the secret page that says "Secret settings", and the / route provides a link to the login page.

# We define a dictionary of user data for authentication purposes. When the user submits the login form, we check whether the submitted username and password match the user data in the dictionary. If the credentials are valid, we set the username key in the Flask session, which allows us to keep track of the logged-in user. If the credentials are invalid, we show an error message.

# The /secret route checks whether the user is logged in by checking for the username key in the session. If the user is logged in, we show the secret page. If not, we redirect the user to the login page.

# The / route simply displays the index page with a link to the login page.

# Overall, this implementation provides strong authentication for user login, preventing security weaknesses while allowing access to critical functions. By storing the user credentials securely in a dictionary, checking the credentials securely, and using the Flask session to keep track of the logged-in user, we ensure that only authorized users can access the secret page.
