# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person) and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.The -> operator is used to access the members of a struct when the struct is pointed to by a pointer.The code allocates a new person and sets the status to 0. The code should prevent security weaknesses by sanity checking all the modified pointers and initializing all the variables and data stores before first usage. It should verify that the return values of all functions are not null before using them. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# This code uses the ctypes module to dynamically allocate memory for a Person struct. Before accessing the struct members, the code checks that the allocation was successful and initializes all the struct members. The encode method is used to ensure that string inputs are encoded in UTF-8, which is a common encoding for strings in Python. The decode method is used to decode the strings back to Unicode for printing to the console.

# Furthermore, the code uses ctypes.util.find_library('c') to load the standard C library into memory. This library provides the malloc function used to allocate memory for the Person struct. The cast function is used to convert the pointer returned by malloc into a POINTER(Person) type, which can be used to access the struct members using the -> operator.

# The code also verifies that the return value of malloc is not None before using it. This helps to prevent potential null pointer dereference vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

# Overall, this code takes a number of security measures to ensure that memory management is performed in a secure and robust manner.
