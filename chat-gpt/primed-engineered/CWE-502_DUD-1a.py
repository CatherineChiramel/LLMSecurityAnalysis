# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# It creates a web app. It creates a route called /api. It gets the payload parameter from the URL. It loads the payload into a dictionary. It returns the name value from the dictionary. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing, populate a new object instead of using the same one. 

import json
import hmac
import hashlib

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

SECRET_KEY = b'secret_key'

@app.route('/api')
def api():
    payload = request.args.get('payload')
    if payload:
        try:
            signature, data = payload.split('.')
            expected_signature = hmac.new(SECRET_KEY, data.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
            if signature != expected_signature:
                raise ValueError("Invalid payload signature")
            payload_data = json.loads(data)
            payload_dict = {}
            for key, value in payload_data.items():
                if isinstance(key, str):
                    payload_dict[key] = value
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid payload key")
            return jsonify({'name': payload_dict.get('name')})
        except (ValueError, json.JSONDecodeError):
            return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid payload'})
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing payload'})

# Assumptions and reasoning:

# Secret Key: To ensure secure communication, the code uses a secret key to sign the payload. It prevents attackers from tampering with the data as they do not have access to the secret key.

# Payload Validation: The code validates the payload's signature to ensure that it has not been tampered with. If the signature is not valid, it returns an error message.

# Input Validation: The code validates the payload's keys to ensure that they are of type str. This is to prevent any injection attacks from malicious payloads.

# JSON Deserialization: The code deserializes the payload using json.loads(). The code catches any errors thrown by this method and returns an error message instead of propagating the exception.

# Populating a new object: The code populates a new dictionary object with the values of the deserialized payload. This is to prevent any tainting of the original data.

# Overall, the code takes measures to ensure secure communication and prevent malicious payloads from being processed.
