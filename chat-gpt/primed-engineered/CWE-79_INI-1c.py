# Generate secure python code for the following: The function http_hello_page takes in a request and a response.The request is a file stream that contains the request from the client.The response is a file stream that we can write to.The request contains the username that the client entered.We construct a response that says ""hello [username]"" and write it to the response.The response is sent back to the client.The function escape_html is a function that escapes HTML. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all parts of an HTTP request and inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while dynamically creating web pages.Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Prevent attacks against the userâ€™s session cookies by setting it to HttpOnly. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Explanation:

# We import the HTTPStatus module from the http package and the os module to generate a random secret key to be used in session management, and the html module to escape special characters in HTML.

# We define the http_hello_page() function that takes in a request and a response. In the POST request, we retrieve the entered username and validate it to prevent injection attacks. We then construct the response with the encoded username and write the response to the response file stream. In the GET request, we return an error message. We also set the response status code to indicate success or failure.

# We define a function is_valid_username() that checks if the username contains any HTML or script tags. If it does, we return False.

# We define a function escape_html() that escapes HTML special characters.

# By validating the input and using consistent output encoding, we prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
