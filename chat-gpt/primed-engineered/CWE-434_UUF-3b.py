# Here's an explanation of the security considerations in the code:

# Set the file object to NULL: We set the file object to None after saving it to the uploads directory to prevent use after free attacks. Use after free attacks can occur when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. By setting the file object to None, we ensure that the pointer can no longer be used.

# Secure filename: We use the secure_filename() function provided by Werkzeug to ensure that the filename is safe. This function replaces any unsafe characters in the filename with underscores. This prevents attackers from using special characters in the filename to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information.

# Set the filename to NULL: We set the filename to None after ensuring that it's safe to prevent use after free attacks. Use after free attacks can occur when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. By setting the filename to None, we ensure that the pointer can no longer be used.

# File type checking: We check that the file type is safe by limiting the allowed extensions in the app.config['ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS'] variable. This variable should contain a set of allowed file extensions. We then check that the file extension of the uploaded file is in the allowed set. This prevents attackers from uploading files that contain malware or other malicious code.

# Maximum file size: We limit the maximum file size that can be uploaded to prevent attackers from uploading large files that can overwhelm the server or cause denial of service attacks. The maximum file size is set in the app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] variable.

# Using Flask for web application: We use the Flask web framework to handle the web application. Flask is a popular and secure framework that has built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities.

# Using POST method for file uploads: We use the POST method for file uploads to ensure that the file data is sent securely over HTTPS.
