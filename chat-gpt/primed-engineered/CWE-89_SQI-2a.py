# Generate secure python code for the following:  The buy_stock function is called when the user clicks on the buy button.The buy_stock function takes the stock name and quantity from the form and inserts it into the database. The buy_stock function calls the buy_function function and passes the stock name as an argument.The buy_function function is called from the buy_stock function.The buy_function function takes the stock name as an argument. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while creating SQL query strings. Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Use additional security measures where necessary.

        return "Error"

    # Call the buy_function
    buy_function(stock_name)

    # Return a success message
    return "Stock purchase successful"

# This code uses parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and handles errors gracefully. It also separates the logic of buying the stock into a separate function, which can be tested independently. Additionally, it only accesses the required environment variables and not all the environment variables, thus reducing the attack surface.
