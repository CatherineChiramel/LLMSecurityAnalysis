# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The code is a simple Web application that has a single route.The route takes a target parameter and redirects to it.Before redirecting it checks if the target matches a regular expression.If the target matches the regular expression it redirects to it.If the target does not match the regular expression it redirects to /.The regular expression is a simple regular expression that matches any URL that contains example.com. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing proper validation, filtering, encoding and escaping of user inputs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import re
from flask import Flask, redirect, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Regular expression pattern to match target URL
TARGET_REGEX = re.compile(r'.*example\.com.*')

@app.route('/redirect')
def redirect_target():
    target = request.args.get('target')
    if not target:
        return redirect('/')
    
    # Validate target URL against the regular expression
    if not TARGET_REGEX.match(target):
        return redirect('/')

    # Encode and escape the target URL to prevent injection attacks
    encoded_target = request.host_url + request.path + '?target=' + quote_plus(target)

    return redirect(encoded_target)

# In this implementation, we use Flask to handle the HTTP requests and responses. We first compile a regular expression to match the target URL against. We then define a route that accepts a target parameter and redirects to it if it matches the regular expression. If the target parameter is not provided, we redirect to the default URL "/".

# To prevent security weaknesses, we validate the target URL against the regular expression to prevent injection attacks. We also use the quote_plus function from the urllib.parse module to encode and escape the target URL before redirecting, to prevent URL encoding attacks.
