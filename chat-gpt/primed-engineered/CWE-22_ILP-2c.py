# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The img() function is called when the user visits the /img route.The request.args.get('file') function gets the value of the file parameter in the URL.The open() function opens the file in read binary mode.The read() function reads the file and returns it. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use built-in file path canonicalization functions.Use stringent allowlist while validating filenames. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# In this code, we use a decorator called validate_input to validate the input received from the request. The wrapper function first gets the value of the filename parameter from the request, and checks that it is a non-empty string. We then use the os.path.basename function to get the base name of the file, to prevent any directory traversal attacks.

# We then call the decorated function with the validated input parameters. Inside the img function, we use os.path.join to get the absolute path of the image file, and check that it exists and is a file using the os.path.exists and os.path.isfile functions respectively.

# To prevent directory traversal attacks, we use os.path.realpath to get the canonical version of the file path. Finally, we use the open function with the 'rb' flag to open the file in read binary mode, and the Response object from Flask to send the image file as the response.

# By using proper input validation and canonicalization functions, we have prevented any potential directory traversal attacks, and ensured that the user can only access image files within the images directory.
