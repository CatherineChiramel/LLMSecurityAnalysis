# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code is a web application that listens for HTTP requests on the /api/temperature_for_location endpoint. When a request is received the code above extracts the latitude; longitude; year; month; day and grib_file from the request. The code then connects to the MySQL database and executes a query to find the maximum temperature for the given latitude; longitude; year; month; day and grib_file. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Assumptions and reasoning:

# Secret Key: The code uses a secret key to sign the payload to ensure secure communication between the client and server.

# Payload Validation: The code validates the payload's signature to ensure that it has not been tampered with. If the signature is not valid, it returns an error message.

# Input Validation: The code validates the payload keys to ensure that they are of type str. This is to prevent any injection attacks from malicious payloads.

# JSON Deserialization: The code deserializes the payload using json.loads(). The code catches any errors thrown by this method and returns an error message instead of propagating the exception.

# Populating a new object: The code populates a new dictionary object with the values of the deserialized payload. This is to prevent any tainting of the original data.

# Database Connection: The code connects to the MySQL database and retrieves the maximum temperature data for the given location and date.

# SQL Injection Prevention: The code uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

# Overall, the code takes measures to ensure secure communication and prevent malicious payloads from being processed. It also uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
