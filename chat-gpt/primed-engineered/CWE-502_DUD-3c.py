# Generate secure python code for the following:  The function get_price_for_product_code() returns the price for a product code.The function calculate_price() is a web route that takes a YAML payload as a query parameter. It then loads the YAML payload into a dictionary; extracts the product code and quantity; calculates the total price and returns the total price as a YAML payload. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Assumptions and reasoning:

# Secret Key: The code uses a secret key to sign the payload to ensure secure communication between the client and server.

# Payload Validation: The code validates the payload's signature to ensure that it has not been tampered with. If the signature is not valid, it returns an error message.

# Input Validation: The code validates the payload to ensure that it contains the necessary keys and values. This is to prevent any injection attacks from malicious payloads.

# YAML Deserialization: The code deserializes the payload using yaml.safe_load(). The code catches any errors thrown by this method and returns an error message instead of propagating the exception.

# Populating a new object: The code populates a new dictionary object with the values of the deserialized payload. This is to prevent any tainting of the original data.

# Product Price Lookup: The code looks up the product price using a function named get_price_for_product_code(). This function retrieves the price of the product from a database or a product catalog.

# Response Payload Signing: The code signs the response payload to ensure secure communication between the client and server.

# Overall, the code takes measures to ensure secure communication and prevent malicious payloads from being processed. It also signs the response payload to ensure secure communication between the client and server.
