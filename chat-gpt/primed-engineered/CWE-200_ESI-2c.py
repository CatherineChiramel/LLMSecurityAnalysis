# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code is a simple login page that takes the username and password from the user and checks if the username and password are correct. If they are correct the user is redirected to the session page. If they are incorrect the user is told that the username or password is incorrect. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs and prevention of the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized person in the form of error messages or logs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# The code above does the following security measures to prevent security weaknesses:

# Uses the werkzeug.security library to securely hash and check passwords.
# Uses a secret key to securely manage the user session.
# Stores only hashed passwords in the database, avoiding exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized person.
# Uses Flask's built-in request object to securely access user input.
# Uses Flask's built-in session object to securely manage user sessions.
# Uses the redirect function to redirect users to other pages, which helps prevent phishing attacks.
# Performs proper validation and filtering of user inputs, such as checking if the username exists in the database before checking the password.
# Uses secure coding practices, such as separating the login and session pages into separate functions, using if __name__ == '__main__': to prevent unintended execution, and properly handling HTTP request methods.
