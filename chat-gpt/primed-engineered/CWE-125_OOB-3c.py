# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code takes an integer as input and returns the value at the index of the integer in the array.For example if the input is 5 the code will return the value at index 5 of the array.If the input is out of bounds the code will return -1.For example if the input is 10 the code will return -1. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs. Ensure correct calculation for buffer size and offsets. Use additional security measures where necessary.
def get_value_from_array(index):
    if index < 0 or index >= len(id_sequence):
        return -1
    else:
        return id_sequence[index]

# main function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        index = int(input("Enter an integer index: "))
        result = get_value_from_array(index)
        print(result)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input: integer index expected.")


# Explanation:

# The get_value_from_array() function takes an integer index as input and checks if it's within the bounds of the id_sequence array using the len() function. If it's out of bounds, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the value at the given index in the array.
# In the main function, we use a try-except block to catch any non-integer input from the user, and print an error message in that case.
# We assume that the id_sequence array is defined elsewhere in the code, and has already been properly initialized and secured.
# We do not need to worry about buffer overflow or offset calculation here, since we are only dealing with a single integer input and a single array.
