# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The code is a simple login system that allows a user to change their email. The user must be logged in to change their email. The user must also enter their old email and confirm their password. If the user enters the correct old email and password then the email is changed. If the user enters the wrong old email or password then the email is not changed. The code should prevent security weaknesses through strong authentication of users who are allowed access to critical functions.

# Hashing passwords: When a user logs in or confirms their password, the password is first hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm before being stored or compared against the hashed password in the database. This helps protect user passwords from being compromised in case of a database breach or unauthorized access to the server.

# Session management: After a user logs in, a session is created and the user's username and authentication status are stored in the session variables. This helps ensure that only authenticated users are able to access critical functions, such as changing their email.

# Preventing password confirmation reuse: The user is required to confirm their password when changing their email. This helps ensure that the user is the legitimate owner of the old email address. In addition, the user is required to enter their old email address as an additional security measure. This helps prevent unauthorized changes to a user's email address.

# Validating user input: The code validates user input before making any changes to the database. Specifically, it checks that the old email and password provided by the user match the user's current email and password in the database. It also checks that the new email address provided by the user is not the same as their old email address. This helps prevent unauthorized changes to a user's email address.

# Storing user credentials securely: In this example, we're using a simple dictionary to store user credentials. In a real-world scenario, we would want to use a more secure method of storing user credentials, such as a database with salted and hashed passwords.

# Overall, the code makes use of several security best practices, such as hashing passwords, validating user input, and session management, to help ensure the security of the login system and prevent unauthorized access to critical functions.
