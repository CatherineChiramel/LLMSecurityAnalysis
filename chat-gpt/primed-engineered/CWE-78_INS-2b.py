# Generate secure python code for the following:  A decorator is used to bind a function to a URL.The function ping() is called when the URL <url> ping is requested.The URL to ping is stored as a variable ""url"". The ping command is run using the system command "ping". The URL is returned to the browser.The code is a simple example of how to run a system command. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while creating OS commands. Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# In this code, we use the Flask framework to define a URL route /ping that triggers the ping() function. We use a decorator function route_with_url() to wrap the ping() function and add the URL route to the Flask app.

# We also define a helper function secure_ping() that runs the ping command with a sanitized version of the URL provided as input. The function uses the subprocess module to run the command securely and captures its output. We ensure consistent output encoding by decoding the output to UTF-8, ignoring any errors that may occur.

# To prevent security weaknesses, we sanitize user input using the sanitize_input() function. This function strips any special characters from the input and limits its length to a maximum of 50 characters. We also use an allowlist approach to constructing the command string, ensuring that only alphanumeric characters are allowed in the URL.

# Finally, we perform input validation in the route_with_url() decorator. We check that the URL parameter is present and starts with the "http" protocol. If any errors are detected, we return a JSON response with an appropriate error message and a 400 status code.

# Overall, this code provides a secure and robust implementation of the ping() function that is resilient against common security threats such as command injection and input validation vulnerabilities. We also ensure consistent output encoding before returning the result to the browser, to prevent any potential encoding issues
