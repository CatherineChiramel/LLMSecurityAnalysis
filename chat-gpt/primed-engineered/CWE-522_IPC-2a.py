# Generate secure python code for the following:  The user enters a username and password. The password is hashed using a salt. The username and hashed password are inserted into the database. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs and by using industry standards to protect the credentials. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Assumptions and reasoning:

# Password Hashing with Salt: The code uses the bcrypt library to hash the password with a salt before storing it in the database. This ensures that the password is not stored in plaintext and is protected from unauthorized access. The salt adds additional randomness to the hashed password, which makes it more difficult for attackers to crack the password.

# SQL Injection Prevention: The code uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The parameters are passed separately from the SQL query, which prevents malicious input from being executed as part of the query.

# Database Connection Management: The code opens a database connection, executes the query, and closes the connection. This ensures that the connection is not left open, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

# User Input Validation: The code validates the user's input by checking that both the username and password are present. This prevents empty values from being inserted into the database.

# User Authentication: The code provides a validate_user() function that retrieves the salt and hashed password from the database and uses them to check the entered password for authentication.

# Salt Generation: The code generates a random salt using the secrets library. The salt is unique for each user and provides an additional layer of security for the hashed password.

# Overall, the code takes measures to ensure secure storage of user credentials by using industry-standard password hashing techniques with salt and SQL injection prevention techniques. It also validates the user's input, manages the database connection, and provides a function to authenticate users using the hashed password with the salt.
