# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code is a simple script that accepts an image file and stores it in a MySQL database. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs. Ensure that the file of the correct content type and extension is  being uploaded. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Here's an explanation of the security considerations in the code:

# Prepared statements: We use prepared statements when interacting with the MySQL database to prevent SQL injection attacks. Prepared statements are a way of writing database queries that separate the query structure from the user input. This ensures that user input is properly sanitized and cannot be used to modify the query structure.

# Set the filepath to NULL: We set the filepath to None after reading the contents of the file to prevent use after free attacks. Use after free attacks can occur when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. By setting the filepath to None, we ensure that the pointer can no longer be used.

# Check that the file exists: We check that the file exists before reading its contents to ensure that the script doesn't crash if the user enters an invalid filepath.

# Check that the file is an image: We check that the file has an image extension (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp) to ensure that the script doesn't attempt to save non-image files to the database.

# Using input() to get user input: We use the input() function to prompt the user for the filepath of the image. While this function is convenient, it can also be a security risk if the user enters unexpected input (like a command that could be executed on the command line). To mitigate this risk, it's important to validate user input before using it in the script.
