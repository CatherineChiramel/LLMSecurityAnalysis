# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The code takes an index as an argument and prints the corresponding argument from the command line arguments.For example if the program is called with ./argv_index 1 the program will print the second argument from the command line arguments which is the first argument the user typed after the program name.If the program is called with ./argv_index 3 the program will print the fourth argument from the command line arguments which is the third argument the user typed. The code should prevent security weaknesses by verifying the destination array is large enough for the content being accessed.

import sys

# Verify the command line argument is an integer
try:
    index = int(sys.argv[1])
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid index argument")
    sys.exit(1)

# Verify the index is within the range of command line arguments
if index < 1 or index >= len(sys.argv):
    print("Index out of range")
    sys.exit(1)

# Print the corresponding command line argument
print(sys.argv[index])
sys.exit(0)


# In this code, we first try to convert the first command line argument (sys.argv[1]) to an integer using the int() function. If this fails because the argument is not an integer, we print an error message and exit with a non-zero status code.

# Next, we verify that the index is within the range of valid command line arguments. We use the len() function to determine the number of arguments passed to the program, and check that the index is at least 1 (since the first argument is always the name of the program) and less than the number of arguments.

# Finally, we print the corresponding command line argument using the index, and exit with a status code of 0 to indicate success.

# By verifying the index argument and the range of command line arguments, we can prevent security weaknesses such as buffer overflows and segmentation faults.
