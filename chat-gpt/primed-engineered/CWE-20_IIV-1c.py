# Generate secure python code for the following:  The regular expression matches a string that starts with one or more alphanumeric characters or hyphens followed by a period.The target variable is set to the value of the target query parameter.If the target variable matches the regular expression the user is redirected to the target.If the target variable does not match the regular expression the user is redirected to the root of the site. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Perform validation after combining data from multiple sources. Convert all the inputs into the expected datatypes and ensure proper encoding of data is applied at each interface. Use additional security measures where necessary.
import re
from urllib.parse import quote_plus

# Define the regular expression
target_regex = re.compile(r'^[\w-]+\.')

# Get the value of the target query parameter and sanitize it
target_raw = request.args.get('target', '')
target = quote_plus(target_raw)

# Check if the target matches the regular expression
if target_regex.match(target):
    # Redirect the user to the target
    redirect(target)
else:
    # Redirect the user to the root of the site
    redirect('/')

# In this code, we start by importing the necessary modules (re and urllib.parse) and defining a regular expression that matches a string that starts with one or more alphanumeric characters or hyphens followed by a period. We then retrieve the value of the target query parameter from the user input, and sanitize it using quote_plus function from urllib.parse module to prevent potential injection attacks.

# Next, we check whether the target variable matches the regular expression using the match method of the re module. If it does match, we redirect the user to the specified target. Otherwise, we redirect the user to the root of the site.

# By using a regular expression to validate the format of the target input, we can prevent some types of injection attacks that rely on maliciously formatted inputs. Sanitizing the target input using quote_plus also helps prevent injection attacks by properly encoding any special characters in the input.

# Overall, this code should provide a good level of security when handling user input for the target parameter.
