# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The upload_pdf() function is called when the user uploads a pdf file. The pdf file is saved in the uploads folder. The filepath of the pdf file is saved in the mysql database. The filepath is then used to download the pdf file. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks use additional security measures where necessary.

# Here's an explanation of the security considerations in the code:

# Random filenames: We generate random filenames to prevent filename collisions. This ensures that an attacker cannot upload a file with a filename that overwrites an existing file, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information.

# Prepared statements: We use prepared statements when interacting with the MySQL database to prevent SQL injection attacks. Prepared statements are a way of writing database queries that separate the query structure from the user input. This ensures that user input is properly sanitized and cannot be used to modify the query structure.

# Use of with statement: We use the with statement when working with file objects to ensure that the file is properly closed when we're done with it. This prevents resource leaks and potential denial of service attacks.

# Use after free attacks: We set the filepath to NULL after downloading the file to prevent use after free attacks. Use after free attacks can occur when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. By setting the filepath to NULL, we ensure that the pointer can no longer be used
