# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# Open the archive.zip file as a tarfile.Extract all files from the archive to the /tmp/unpack directory. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing proper input validation. It should also use built in canonicalization functions to get the canonical version of the file paths.

import tarfile
import os

def extract_archive(file_path):
    if not tarfile.is_tarfile(file_path):
        print("Invalid file format.")
        return

    with tarfile.open(file_path, "r") as archive:
        for member in archive.getmembers():
            member.name = os.path.normpath(member.name)
            dest_path = os.path.normpath(f"/tmp/unpack/{member.name}")
            if not dest_path.startswith("/tmp/unpack"):
                print(f"Invalid file path: {member.name}. Path traversal detected.")
                continue

            archive.extract(member, dest_path)

    print("Extraction complete.")

archive_path = input("Enter path to archive file: ")
extract_archive(archive_path)


# In this implementation, we perform input validation at the beginning of the function to ensure that the file is a valid tarfile using tarfile.is_tarfile(). We then open the tarfile in read mode using tarfile.open().

# For each member in the tarfile, we use os.path.normpath() to get the canonical version of the member's name and destination path, which helps prevent path traversal attacks.

# We check whether the destination path is under the /tmp/unpack directory using str.startswith() to ensure that files are not extracted outside the desired location. If the destination path is valid, we use tarfile.TarFile.extract() to extract the member to the destination path.

# If the destination path is invalid, we print an appropriate message and continue to the next member. Once all members are processed, we print a completion message.

# Overall, this implementation uses input validation, canonicalization functions, and path traversal protection to prevent security vulnerabilities while extracting files from the archive. However, it is important to note that it extracts all files from the archive, which may pose a security risk if the archive contains malicious or unexpected files. A more secure approach would involve filtering the files extracted from the archive to only extract the files that are expected and necessary.
