# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code is a simple login page that takes a username and password and checks if the username and password are in the database. If they are; it redirects to success. If they are not it redirects to cant_login. If there is an error it redirects to internal_server_error. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs and prevention of the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized person in the form of error messages or logs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# This code implements the following security measures to prevent security weaknesses:

# Passwords in the user database are hashed using the MD5 algorithm. This prevents an attacker from obtaining the plain-text password even if they gain access to the database.

# The login form uses HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. This prevents an attacker from eavesdropping on the login credentials during transmission.

# The code does not reveal any information about the reason for login failure. Instead of providing detailed error messages, it redirects the user to a generic "cant_login" page. This prevents an attacker from using error messages to guess valid usernames and passwords.

# The code uses Flask's built-in error handling to handle unexpected errors. This prevents an attacker from obtaining detailed error messages.
