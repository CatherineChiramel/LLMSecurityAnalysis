# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The code is a simple web application that has a route /redirect/<url> that takes a URL as a parameter.The function redirect_invalid_url() checks if the URL is from example.com. If it is it redirects the user to the URL. If it is not it returns an error message. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing proper validation, sanitization, filtering, encoding and escaping of all user inputs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import urllib.parse
from flask import Flask, request, abort, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/redirect/<path:url>')
def redirect_invalid_url(url):
    # Validate the URL by checking that it starts with http:// or https://
    if not url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
        abort(400)

    # Sanitize the URL by removing any query parameters and fragments
    url = urllib.parse.urldefrag(url)[0]
    url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)._replace(query=None).geturl()

    # Filter the URL by checking that it only contains valid characters
    if not all(c.isprintable() and c not in '"\'<>\{\}|\\\^`' for c in url):
        abort(400)

    # Encode the URL by converting any non-ASCII characters to percent-encoded UTF-8
    url = urllib.parse.quote(url, safe=':/?=&#')

    # Escape the URL by replacing any percent-encoded characters with their ASCII equivalents
    url = urllib.parse.unquote(url)

    # Parse the URL to extract the domain name
    parsed_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)
    domain_name = parsed_url.netloc

    # Check if the domain name is example.com and redirect or return an error message accordingly
    if domain_name == 'example.com':
        return redirect(url)
    else:
        error_msg = "Sorry, you can only redirect to URLs from example.com"
        return error_msg, 400

    app.run()


# In this code, we use Flask to create a web application with a route /redirect/<path:url> that accepts a URL as a parameter. We then perform the same validation, sanitization, filtering, encoding, and escaping steps as in the previous example to ensure that the user-supplied URL is safe to use.

# We also added a few additional security measures to further protect against attacks. First, we set the path parameter in the @app.route decorator to path:url, which allows the URL parameter to contain slashes. This is important because it prevents attackers from bypassing URL filters by adding slashes to the URL.

# Second, we use the abort function to return a 400 Bad Request error if the URL does not pass validation or filtering. This helps to prevent attackers from guessing valid URLs by receiving an error message that does not reveal any information about the system.

# Finally, we use the Flask redirect function to safely redirect the user to the supplied URL if the domain name is example.com. If the domain name is not example.com, we return a custom error message with a 400 Bad Request status code to indicate that the user-supplied URL is not allowed.

# By performing proper validation, sanitization, filtering, encoding, and escaping of user inputs, and using additional security measures where necessary, we can help to prevent security vulnerabilities and protect against attacks.
