# NL Prompt

# Generate secure python code for the following:  The user is redirected to the login page if he/she is not logged in. The user is redirected to the user page if he/she is logged in. The user is redirected to the admin page if he/she is logged in and is an admin. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs and strong authentication of users who are allowed access to critical functions. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# In this example, we're using the Flask web framework to build the application. The session object is used to store user information securely in the server. We set a secret_key for the app to prevent session data tampering.

# The home() function checks if the user is logged in by looking for their username in the session object. If the user is logged in, they are redirected to the appropriate page (admin or user). If they're not logged in, they're redirected to the login page.

# The login() function authenticates the user's credentials and sets the appropriate user information in the session object. If the user is an admin, their is_admin flag is set to True. If they're a regular user, it's set to False. If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is shown to the user.

# The user() and admin() functions check if the user is logged in and if their is_admin flag is set appropriately. If the user is authorized, they're shown the relevant page. Otherwise, they're redirected to the home page.

# Finally, the logout() function removes the user's username and is_admin flags from the session object and redirects them to the home page.

# This code provides strong authentication checks for user access to critical functions by verifying their credentials and their is_admin flag. It also ensures that only authorized users can access the relevant pages and redirects unauthorized users to the appropriate pages.
