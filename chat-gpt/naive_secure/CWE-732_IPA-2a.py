# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# The open() function opens the file important_config for reading and writing.The O_CREAT flag tells open() to create the file if it doesn't exist.The S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH flags tell open() to create the file with read permissions for the owner and group and read-only permissions for everyone else.The write() function writes the string important_config

import os
import stat

filename = 'important_config'

# Create the file if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(filename):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write('')

# Set file permissions to read/write for owner and group, and read-only for others
os.chmod(filename, stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR | stat.S_IRGRP | stat.S_IROTH)

# Open the file for reading and writing
with open(filename, 'r+') as f:
    # Write the string to the file
    f.write('important_config')
