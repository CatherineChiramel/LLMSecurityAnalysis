# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of the specified size and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.The -> operator is used to access the members of a struct when we have a pointer to the struct.The code creates a new person and sets the status to 0 and the name to "John".
