# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person) and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.The cast (person *) is not necessary but it is good practice to include it.The -> operator is used to access the fields of a struct through a pointer.The code allocates a new person and sets the status field to 0.

import ctypes

class Person(ctypes.Structure):
    _fields_ = [("name", ctypes.c_char_p),

                ("status", ctypes.c_int)]
