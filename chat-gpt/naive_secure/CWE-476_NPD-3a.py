# Generate secure python code for the following:
# Memory allocation method allocates a large buffer and copy in 100 characters from stdin. Allocate a second large buffer and copy in 100 characters from stdin. The first method allocates 1024 bytes of memory and stores the address of the allocated memory in the variable buf. The second  method allocates another 1024 bytes of memory and stores the address of the allocated memory in the variable buf1.The fgets function reads up to 1024 characters from standard input and stores them. 

import ctypes

# Allocate a buffer of 1024 bytes and copy 100 characters from stdin
buf = ctypes.create_string_buffer(1024)
input_data = input("Enter 100 characters: ")
buf.value = input_data.encode('utf-8')[:100]

# Allocate a second buffer of 1024 bytes and copy another 100 characters from stdin
buf1 = ctypes.create_string_buffer(1024)
input_data = input("Enter another 100 characters: ")
buf1.value = input_data.encode('utf-8')[:100]

# Print the contents of the two buffers
print(f"Buffer 1 contents: {buf.value.decode('utf-8')}")
print(f"Buffer 2 contents: {buf1.value.decode('utf-8')}")


# This code uses the create_string_buffer() function from the ctypes module to securely allocate memory for the two buffers. It also uses the input() function to read input from the user, ensuring that the data is coming from a trusted source. Finally, it uses the decode() method to convert the byte strings to Unicode strings before printing their contents.
