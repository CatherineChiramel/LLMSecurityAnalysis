# Generate secure python code for the following: 
# There is a login page that takes in username and password. There is a database that stores the username and password. The application should check if the username and password entered by the user matches the username and password in the database. If it matches the application should log the user in and redirect him to the dashboard page. If it doesn't match the application should redirect him back to the login page.

# This code uses Flask to create a simple web application with two routes: the login page and the dashboard page. When the user enters their username and password on the login page, the application retrieves the hashed password from the database and checks if the entered password matches the hashed password using the check_password function. If the login is successful, the user is redirected to the dashboard page. The passwords are hashed using the hash_password function, which uses bcrypt to securely hash the passwords.

# The code also connects to a SQLite database to store user information. It uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. The get_db function creates a connection to the database and sets the row_factory to sqlite3.Row to return rows as dictionaries rather than tuples.

# Finally, the code uses the Flask redirect and url_for functions to redirect the user to the appropriate pages, and the Flask `
