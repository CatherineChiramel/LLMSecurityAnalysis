# NL Prompt

# Generate python code for the following: 
# The scan function reads in a string from the standard input. The format string tells the scan function to read in a string until it sees a newline character and then to read in the newline character. The newline character is not stored in the buffer.

# Read a string from standard input until a newline character is encountered
# The newline character is not stored in the buffer
input_string = input()

# Extract the first 1023 characters
input_string = input_string[:1023]
