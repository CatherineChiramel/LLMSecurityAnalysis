# Generate python code for the following: 
# The code creates a file called important_config.The file is created with the permissions S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR which means that the file is readable and writable by the owner of the file.The file is opened with the flags O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_WRONLY which means that the file is created if it does not exist and truncated to zero length if it does exist

import os

# Set the file permissions
file_permissions = 0o600  # S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR = 0o600

# Open the file with the specified flags
flags = os.O_CREAT | os.O_TRUNC | os.O_WRONLY
with os.fdopen(os.open('important_config', flags, file_permissions), 'w') as f:
    # Write data to the file
    f.write('This is important config data')
