# Generate python code for the following: 
# The open() function opens the file important_config for reading and writing.The O_CREAT flag tells open() to create the file if it doesn't exist.The S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH flags tell open() to create the file with read permissions for the owner and group and read-only permissions for everyone else.The write() function writes the string important_config

import os

# open the file with read and write permissions
file_path = "important_config"
file_flags = os.O_CREAT | os.O_RDWR
file_mode = 0o640  # S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH
with os.fdopen(os.open(file_path, file_flags, file_mode), "w+") as file:
    # write the string to the file
    file.write("important_config")
