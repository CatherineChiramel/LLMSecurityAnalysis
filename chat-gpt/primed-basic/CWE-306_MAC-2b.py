# This code defines a Flask web application that has three routes: /, /do_login, /user_page, and /admin_page.

# When a user visits the / route, the login function is called and a login form is rendered using the login.html template. When the user submits the login form via the /do_login route, the do_login function is called using a POST request. It checks the username and password against the database using the authenticate function from a separate database module. If the username and password match, the user's username is stored in the session and the user is redirected to either the /user_page or /admin_page route depending on whether they are an admin or not.

# The /user_page and /admin_page routes both check if the user is logged in by checking if their username is stored in the session. If the user is logged in, they are shown either the user.html or admin.html template depending on their admin status. If the user is not logged in, they are redirected to the / route (the login page).

# Overall, this code is designed to provide basic authentication and authorization functionality for a web application. The secret_key variable is used to encrypt and secure the session data, and the use of Flask's render_template function helps prevent against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by properly escaping any user input in the HTML templates. Additionally, the code checks for user authentication and authorization at each step of the process to ensure that only authorized users can access certain pages or functions.
