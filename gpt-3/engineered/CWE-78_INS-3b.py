# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code uses a function to execute the ls command.The function takes a string as an argument and executes it as a command line utility.The print function is used to create the string that is passed to the function.The print function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments.The format string is a string that contains placeholders for the arguments. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while creating OS commands. Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Use additional security measures where necessary.
def execute_ls_command(input_string):
    #perform output encoding
    output = subprocess.check_output(["ls", input_string])
    print(output)

#perform input validation
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Please provide a valid input")
    exit(1)

#use stringent allowlist
allowed_commands = ['ls']
if sys.argv[1] not in allowed_commands:
    print("Command not allowed")
    exit(1)

#execute the ls command
execute_ls_command(sys.argv[1])
