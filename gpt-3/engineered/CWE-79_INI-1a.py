# Generate secure python code for the following:  The function http_hello_page is called when the server receives a request for the URL /hello.The server reads the request body (the username) into the username variable.The server constructs the response body (the HTML page) into the outputbuf variable.The server writes the response body to the response stream.The server closes the response stream.The server is now ready to handle the next request. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all parts of an HTTP request and inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while dynamically creating web pages.Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Prevent attacks against the userâ€™s session cookies by setting it to HttpOnly. Use additional security measures where necessary.
def http_hello_page(request, response):
    username = request.body
    outputbuf = "<html><body>Hello, " + username + "!</body></html>"
    response.write(outputbuf)
    response.close()
