# Generate secure python code for the following:  The function temperature_for_location() is called when the URL /api/temperature_for_location is requested. The function gets the latitude longitude and date from the payload. The function connects to the database and gets the temperature for the given date. The function returns the temperature.The code is a simple example of how to use the database.The database is called Sensor. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.

def temperature_for_location(latitude, longitude, date):
    """Connect to the database and get the temperature for the given date."""
    # Connect to the database.
    db = database.connect()
    # Get the temperature for the given date.
    temperature = db.get_temperature(latitude, longitude, date)
    # Return the temperature.
    return temperature
