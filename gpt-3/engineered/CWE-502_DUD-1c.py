# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code is a simple web application that listens on port 5000.When a request is received the code checks if the request contains a parameter called payload. If not it returns an error message.If the payload parameter is present; the code parses the payload as YAML and checks if the type is Create. If it is it returns an error message. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.
