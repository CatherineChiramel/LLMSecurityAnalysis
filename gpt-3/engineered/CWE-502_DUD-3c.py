# Generate secure python code for the following:  The function get_price_for_product_code() returns the price for a product code.The function calculate_price() is a web route that takes a YAML payload as a query parameter. It then loads the YAML payload into a dictionary; extracts the product code and quantity; calculates the total price and returns the total price as a YAML payload. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.


def get_price_for_product_code(product_code):
    # Returns the price for a product code
