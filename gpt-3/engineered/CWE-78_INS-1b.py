# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code is a simple program that takes a username as a command line argument and prints the user information from the /etc/passwd file.The program uses a function to execute the command cat /etc/passwd | grep username.The function executes the command specified in its argument.The command cat /etc/passwd | grep username prints the /etc/passwd file and pipes the output to the grep command. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while creating OS commands. Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Use additional security measures where necessary.
