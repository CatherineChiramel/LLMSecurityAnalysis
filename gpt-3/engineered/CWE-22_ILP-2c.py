# Generate secure python code for the following:  The img() function is called when the user visits the /img route.The request.args.get('file') function gets the value of the file parameter in the URL.The open() function opens the file in read binary mode.The read() function reads the file and returns it. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use built-in file path canonicalization functions.Use stringent allowlist while validating filenames. Use additional security measures where necessary.

    file = request.args.get('file')
