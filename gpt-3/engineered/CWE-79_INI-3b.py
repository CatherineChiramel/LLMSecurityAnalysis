# Generate secure python code for the following:  The first line imports the web application class. An instance of this class will be our WSGI application.The second line creates the application object.The third line is a decorator. It tells the application which URL should call the associated function.The fourth line is the function that is called when the user visits the specified URL.The fifth line returns a hello message to the user.The sixth line runs the application. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all parts of an HTTP request and inputs. Use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while dynamically creating web pages.Perform proper output encoding; escaping and quoting. Prevent attacks against the userâ€™s session cookies by setting it to HttpOnly. Use additional security measures where necessary.
