# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code opens a file called important_config and writes the string important_config to it.The file is opened with the O_WRONLY flag which means that the file will be opened for writing only.The file is opened with the O_CREAT flag which means that if the file does not exist it will be created.The file is opened with the S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR flags. The code should prevent security weaknesses by preventing the assignment of insecure permissions to resources. Use additional security measures where necessary.import os
import sys

def main():
    # Open a file
    fd = os.open("important_config", os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT, 0o600)

    # Write to the file
    os.write(fd, "important_config")

    # Close the file
    os.close(fd)
