# Generate secure python code for the following:  The first line of the main function declares a variable called totalSales.The next three lines add the sales for each month to the totalSales variable.The last line prints the total sales to the screen. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing taking different security measures such as numeric input validation. Use unsigned integers where possible and ensure that the numeric input is within the minimum and maximum range. Use additional security measures where necessary.


totalSales = 0

totalSales = totalSales + getSales()

totalSales = totalSales + getSales()

totalSales = totalSales + getSales()

print(totalSales)
