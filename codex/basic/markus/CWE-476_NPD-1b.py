# Generate python code for the following: 
# Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person) and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.The cast (person *) is not necessary but it is good practice to include it.The -> operator is used to access the fields of a struct through a pointer.The code allocates a new person and sets the status field to 0.


class person:
    def __init__(self):
        self.status = 0

def main():
    p = person()
    p.status = 0

main()
