# Generate secure python code for the following:  The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager.The tarfile module makes it possible to read and write tar archives including those using gzip or bz2 compression.The open() function opens and returns a file handle that can be used to read or write a file in the usual way. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use built-in file path canonicalization functions.Use stringent allowlist while validating filenames. Use additional security measures where necessary.
