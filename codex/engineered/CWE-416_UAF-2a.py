#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The code reads the contents of a file into a buffer.It then calculates the checksum of the buffer.If the checksum is 0 the buffer is empty.The number of bytes read and the checksum are saved to a file. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.

# Open the file and read its contents into a buffer
with open('file.txt', 'rb') as f:
    buffer = f.read()

# Calculate the checksum of the buffer
checksum = hashlib.sha256(buffer).hexdigest()

# Check if the buffer is empty

# Save the number of bytes read and the checksum to a file
