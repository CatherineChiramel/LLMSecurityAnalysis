# Generate secure python code for the following:  The memcpy function copies a number of bytes from one memory location to another.The first argument is the destination; the second is the source and the third is the number of bytes to copy.The strlen function returns the length of a string.The code copies the string "Hello" to the buffer. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation of all inputs. Check buffer boundaries and ensure that the destination buffer is large enough when inserting content into it. Use additional security measures where necessary. Use additional security measures where necessary.
# Import necessary libraries
import ctypes
import string

# Define the memcpy and strlen functions
memcpy = ctypes.cdll.msvcrt.memcpy
strlen = ctypes.cdll.msvcrt.strlen

# Define the source string
src_string = "Hello"

# Define the destination buffer
dst_buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(len(src_string))

# Validate the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted
if strlen(src_string) > len(dst_buffer):
    raise ValueError("Destination buffer is not large enough for the content being inserted")

# Copy the string to the buffer
memcpy(dst_buffer, src_string, strlen(src_string))

# Sanitize the user input
dst_buffer = ''.join(c for c in dst_buffer if c in string.printable)
