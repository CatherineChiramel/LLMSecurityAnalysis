#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The code is a simple registration form that takes the username and password from the user and hashes the password. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using industry standards to protect the credentials. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import hashlib
import uuid

# Generate a random salt
salt = uuid.uuid4().hex

# Get username and password from user
username = input("Please enter your username: ")
password = input("Please enter your password: ")

# Hash the password using SHA-256
hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(salt.encode() + password.encode()).hexdigest() + ':' + salt

# Store the username and hashed password in a secure database
# ...

# Verify the user's credentials
