# Generate secure python code for the following:  The regular expression is compiled once when the module is loaded.The regular expression is used to match the target URL.If the target URL matches it is used as the redirect target.If the target URL does not match a default URL is used.The regular expression is not used to construct the redirect URL. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Perform validation after combining data from multiple sources. Convert all the inputs into the expected datatypes and ensure proper encoding of data is applied at each interface. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import re

# Compile the regular expression
pattern = re.compile(r'^/target/url$')

# Default URL to use if the target URL does not match
default_url = 'https://www.example.com/default'

# Function to perform the redirect
def redirect(url):
    # Validate the URL
    if not url or not isinstance(url, str):
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL')
    
    # Filter the URL
    url = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9/:._-]', '', url)
    
    # Encode and escape the URL
