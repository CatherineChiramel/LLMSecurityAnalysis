#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The code is a simple web application that accepts a file upload and saves it to the uploads directory.The file_is_safe_type function is a stub that always returns true.The upload_file function is the function that handles the file upload. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.
