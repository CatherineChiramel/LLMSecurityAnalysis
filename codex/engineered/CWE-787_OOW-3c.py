#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The code is a program that takes in a command line argument and prints it out to the console. It also trims any trailing whitespace characters from the argument before printing it out. The code should prevent security weaknesses by verifying the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted. Use additional security measures where necessary.
#


import sys
import re

# Check if the command line argument is valid
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Error: Invalid command line argument")
    sys.exit(1)

# Get the command line argument
cmd_arg = sys.argv[1]

# Trim any trailing whitespace characters
cmd_arg = re.sub(r'\s+$', '', cmd_arg)

# Verify the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted
if len(cmd_arg) > 1024:
    print("Error: Command line argument is too long")
    sys.exit(1)

# Print the command line argument
print(cmd_arg)
