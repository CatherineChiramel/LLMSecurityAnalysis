#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: There is a form in an html page that allows the user to upload a pdf file. There is a web server that is running on the user's localhost. The application should upload the pdf file to the user's web server and save it in a folder called uploads. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.
