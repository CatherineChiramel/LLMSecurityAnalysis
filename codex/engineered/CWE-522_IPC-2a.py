#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The user enters a username and password. The password is hashed using a salt. The username and hashed password are inserted into the database. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using industry standards to protect the credentials. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import hashlib
import random

# Generate a random salt
salt = random.randint(1, 99999)

# Get the username and password from the user
username = input("Please enter your username: ")
password = input("Please enter your password: ")

# Hash the password using the salt
hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(str(salt) + password).hexdigest()

# Insert the username and hashed password into the database
# Use industry standard security measures to protect the credentials
# such as using a secure connection and encrypting the data
# before sending it to the database

# Connect to the database

# Execute the query
