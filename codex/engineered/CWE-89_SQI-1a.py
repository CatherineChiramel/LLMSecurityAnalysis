#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The user enters their email address into the unsubscribe form on the website. The email address is passed to the unsubscribe function.The unsubscribe function connects to the database and checks if the email address is in the database.If the email address is in the database it is removed.If the email address is not in the database the user is told that they are not in the database. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing consistent output encoding and input validation. It should also use stringent allowlist to limit the character set while constructing SQL query. Use additional security measures where necessary.
#


def unsubscribe(email):
    # Validate the email address
    if not re.match(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+", email):
        return False
    
    # Sanitize the email address
    email = email.replace("'", "''")
    
    # Construct the SQL query
    query = f"DELETE FROM users WHERE email = '{email}'"
    
    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Execute the query
    cursor.execute(query)
    conn.commit()
    
    # Check if the email address was in the database
    if cursor.rowcount == 0:
        return False
    else:
        return True
