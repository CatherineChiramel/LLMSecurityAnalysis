#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of the specified size and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block. Access the members of a struct when we have a pointer to the struct.The code allocates a new person and sets the status to 0. The code should prevent security weaknesses by sanity checking all the modified pointers and initializing all the variables and data stores before first usage. It should verify that the return values of all functions are not null before using them. Use additional security measures where necessary.
