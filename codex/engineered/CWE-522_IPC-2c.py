#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The code is a simple registration form that takes in a username and password. The password is then hashed using the pbkdf2_hmac algorithm. The salt is generated using the os.urandom function. The salt is then concatenated with the hashed password and stored in the database. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using industry standards to protect the credentials. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import os
import hashlib
import binascii

# Get username and password from user
username = input("Please enter your username: ")
password = input("Please enter your password: ")

# Generate a random salt
salt = os.urandom(16)

# Hash the password using the pbkdf2_hmac algorithm
dk = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode('utf-8'), salt, 100000)

# Convert the salt and hashed password to hexadecimal
hashed_password = binascii.hexlify(salt + dk)

# Store the username and hashed password in the database
# Additional security measures such as encryption should be used
# to protect the credentials
database.store_credentials(username, hashed_password)
