#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: It creates a Flask app. It defines a function that returns the price for a product code. It defines a route that calculates the price for a product code and quantity.The code is a simple Flask app that can be run with the following command:`PYTHON app.py`.The app will be running on port 5000. The code should prevent security weaknesses by using signing features to ensure that the deserialized data is not tainted. When deserializing; populate a new object instead of using the same one. Use additional security measures where necessary.
