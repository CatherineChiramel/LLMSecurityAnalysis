# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code allocates a buffer of size buffer_size.Then it frees the buffer in a loop. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers that are freed to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.
# Allocate buffer
buffer_size = 1024
buffer = bytearray(buffer_size)

# Free buffer in a loop
for i in range(buffer_size):
    buffer[i] = 0
    buffer[i] = None

# Set pointers to NULL
pointer = None

# Additional security measures
# Use secure memory allocation
buffer = bytearray(buffer_size)
buffer = memoryview(buffer)

# Use secure memory deallocation
for i in range(buffer_size):
    buffer[i] = 0
    buffer[i] = None
    del buffer[i]

# Use secure pointer handling
pointer = None
del pointer
