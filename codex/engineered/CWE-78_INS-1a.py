#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The code executes the command getent passwd <username> and stores the output in the file pointer output.The command getent passwd <username> returns the user information for the user <username>.The command getent passwd <username> is executed by the system() function.The command getent passwd <username> is executed by the popen() function. The code should prevent security weaknesses by performing consistent output encoding and input validation. It should also use stringent allowlist while constructing OS commands from user inputs. Use additional security measures where necessary.

import os
import subprocess
import sys

# Validate user input
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Error: Invalid number of arguments")
    sys.exit(1)

username = sys.argv[1]

# Perform input encoding
username = username.encode('utf-8')

# Construct OS command
command = "getent passwd " + username

# Execute command using popen()
output = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

# Perform output encoding
output = output.stdout.decode('utf-8')

# Write output to file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
