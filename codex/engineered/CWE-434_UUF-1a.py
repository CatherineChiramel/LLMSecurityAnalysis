#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The upload_pdf() function is called when the user uploads a pdf file. The pdf file is saved in the uploads folder. The filepath of the pdf file is saved in the mysql database. The filepath is then used to download the pdf file. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks use additional security measures where necessary.
#

def upload_pdf(file):
    # Get the filepath of the pdf file
    filepath = os.path.join('uploads', file.name)
    
    # Save the pdf file in the uploads folder
    file.save(filepath)
    
    # Connect to the database
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(user='user', password='password',
                                   host='host', database='database')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Insert the filepath into the database
    query = "INSERT INTO pdf_files (filepath) VALUES (%s)"
    cursor.execute(query, (filepath,))
    conn.commit()
    
    # Close the connection
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
