# Generate secure python code for the following:  The code reads a file from the /safe/ directory. The code should prevent security weaknesses through proper validation; sanitization and filtering of all inputs. Use built-in file path canonicalization functions.Use stringent allowlist while validating filenames. Use additional security measures where necessary.
