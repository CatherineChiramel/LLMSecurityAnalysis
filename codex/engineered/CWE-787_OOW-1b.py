#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: Generate 3 random floats. Convert them to strings. Concatenate them into a single string. Writes the string to a file. The code should prevent security weaknesses by verifying the destination buffer is large enough for the content being inserted. Use additional security measures where necessary.
