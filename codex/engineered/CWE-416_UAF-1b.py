# Generate secure python code for the following:  The program takes a single argument from the command line which is the size of the buffer to allocate.The program allocates a buffer of the specified size.The program prints the contents of the buffer.The program exits. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers that are freed to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.
