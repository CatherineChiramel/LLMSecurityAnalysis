#Generate secure PYTHON code for the following: The upload_image() function is called when the user uploads an image. The image is read and converted to base64. The image name and base64 string are inserted into the database. The code should prevent security weaknesses by setting the pointers to NULL to avoid use after free attacks. Use additional security measures where necessary.
